Welcome to my collection of Hack The Box writeups! I’m Frederick Mercedes, also known as @tellmefred. Here, you’ll find detailed walkthroughs of various HTB challenges, covering topics such as network security, penetration testing, and vulnerability exploitation. My goal is to share my knowledge and help others learn from my experiences. Feel free to explore, and reach out if you have any questions or feedback!
